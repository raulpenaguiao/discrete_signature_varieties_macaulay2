## V 133

The variety $V_{1, 3, 3}$ has dimension three, degree 81 and the only generator can be obtained by running the code in V133.m2 in Macaulay2 (runs almost instantaneously in typical laptop)

## V 143

The variety $V_{1, 4, 3}$ has dimension three, degree 65536 and can be generated by 20 generators.
One of them can be displayed by running the code in V143.m2 in Macaulay2 (runs almost instantaneously in typical laptop), and any other such generator can be seen by running similar code.

## V 223

The variety $V_{2, 2, 3}$ has dimension six, degree two and can be generated by one generator $s12^2+2*s12*s21+s21^2-4*s11*s22-2*s22*t11-2*s11*t22-t11*t22+2*s12*t12+2*s21*t12+t12^2$.
This can be show by running the code in V223.m2 in Macaulay2 (runs in less that five seconds in typical laptop).

Note that the same polynomial generates an ideal with different dimension and degree in a different ring, for these characteristics depend on the ambient space.

## V 224

The variety $V_{2, 2, 4}$ has dimension six, degree two and can be generated by one generator $s12^2+2*s12*s21+s21^2-4*s11*s22-2*s22*t11-2*s11*t22-t11*t22+2*s12*t12+2*s21*t12+t12^2$, showing that it is the same variety as $V_{2, 2, 3}$.
This can be show by running the code in V224.ms in Macaulay2 (runs in less that 5 seconds in typical laptop).

## V 232

The variety $V_{2, 3, 2}$ has dimension four and degree 27. It is generated by 77 polynomials, one of which is $t111^3+u111^3-t111*u111*v111$.
This can be show by running the code in V232.ms in Macaulay2 (runs almost instantaneously in typical laptop).

## V 322

The variety $V_{3, 2, 2}$ has dimension six and degree 32. It is generated by 24 polynomials, one of which is $s12^2-s11*s22+t12^2+t21^2-2*t11*t22$.
This can be show by running the code in V322.ms in Macaulay2 (runs almost instantaneously in typical laptop).
